# Fruits Theme

This color theme is a combination of Visual Assist X's dark theme and the omnipresent Monokai theme.
It builds upon the following principles:

- Highlight control-flow keywords (red)
- Highlight type and function names as they carry semantics (orange, yellow)
- Remove emphasis from comments, strings, and namespaces
- Keywords and operators serve as *anchor* points (blue)
- Only source code is themed
